### Week 1
During the first week, I worked on trying to decide which subject I wanted to try make my project on, first I decided a restaurant type but that was turned down by Anne because it wasn't practical she adviced me to do it on a record label > artists > album type genre so I went with that and I liked the idea, I made my ERD diagram and first week was basically setting up my Laravel project making sure to install everything like blade and node and setting up the localhost

### Week 2
In the second week I starterd to develop the CRUD, I went on with the lecture notes just basically following those, by the end of the second week I have developed the show method for my artists, you could view all the artists that I have added in my artistcontroller.php from phpmyadmin

### Week 3
The third week was spend on creating the reusable blade components for a cleaner and more maintainable frontend, I made the artist details and the artist form which you could use to create any artist you want, tailwind was used to style and make the layout nice, this week I went up to the lesson 9 in the notes

### Week 4
During the fourth week I finished up the project by adding the store, edit and delete features of the CRUD, I also added an extra feature that embedded youtube videos for each artist so you could listen to one of their songs and also linking their social media handle to their wikipedia page

## Features
- Full CRUD functionality for artists.
- Profile picture uploads and storage.
- Embedded YouTube videos.
- Reusable Blade components for forms, cards, and details.
- Responsive design with TailwindCSS.
- Validation and error handling for all forms.
